This repo contains a project I've done for the Coursera course, offered by Johns Hopkins University as part of the Data Science Specialization.

#Project - Data Products Course
#Top Movies of 2011

For this project I elected to explore the top movies of 2011.
You can access the source code for the Shiny app that I built to provide top-10 lists by filtering the data structure (data provided from the UsingR library) and the supporting slidify slides.
